				<text>A role-playing video game (short: RPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a main character, mostly along with several adventuring party members. Common characteristics for RPGs are player character development, complexity, advanced story-telling and the use of skills and magic in often strategic or tactical battles. Even if the origin of RPGs lies in Japan, they are nowadays developed and released in many countries.</text>
