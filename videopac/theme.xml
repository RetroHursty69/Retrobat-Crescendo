				<text>The Videopac is a game console marketed by Philips in 1978. It was the European version of the Magnavox OdysseyÂ² console produced by the American Magnavox and, like this, had to counteract the newly released Fairchild Channel F and Atari 2600 cartridge consoles. Europe was also marketed as Radiola JET 25, Schneider G7000, Siera G7000 (all Philips companies) and Philips C52 (a version for the French market only). In Brazil it was sold as Philips Odissey.</text>
