				<text>The Texas Instruments TI-99/4A is a home computer, it is a redesign of the TI-99/4 system, which was discontinued. The new "4A" has a new graphics chip and a better keyboard. About the only way to expand the original TI-99/4A was from the expansion port on the right side of the console. Memory expansion, a serial interface, a floppy drive and other peripherals can be plugged in here for added capabilities.</text>
