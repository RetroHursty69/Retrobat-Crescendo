				<text>The Atari Jaguar is a fifth generation (1993–2005) video game console developed and distributed by Atari Corporation. It was released in November 1993 in North America at a retail price of $249.99. The console was later released in Europe (1994), Australia (1994), and Japan (1994). The Jaguar was marketed as being the first 64-bit video game console; however this claim was widely criticized. The console was discontinued in early 1996, possibly at the time of the company's sale on April 8, 1996.</text>
