				<text>The Virtual Boy is a 32-bit table-top video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. Released in 1995, it was marketed as the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D. The player uses the console in a manner similar to a head-mounted display, placing their head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. Sales failed to meet targets, and by early 1996, Nintendo ceased distribution and game development after shipping 1.26 million units and releasing 22 games.</text>
